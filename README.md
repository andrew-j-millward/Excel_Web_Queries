# Excel_Web_Queries
Takes an input URL and converts a table on that page into a formatted Excel spreadsheet.

Example output using data from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics is attached in an .xlsx file. In order to modify the code
to support other applications or develop an independent framework, I have published a detailed guide on how to develop web query 
applications that walks you through step by step how this program works. The published guide is available at http://bit.ly/ExcelQuery
